## 🧠 Core Intelligence (Machine Learning)

The forecasting engine is built on a custom Deep Learning architecture optimized for the unique climatic patterns of the Ethiopian Highlands.

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering
To achieve an **R² of 0.98**, the raw subnational data underwent rigorous transformation:
*   **Cyclical Time Encoding:** Months and Dekads were mapped to `sin` and `cos` coordinates, allowing the model to understand that December (Month 12) is chronologically adjacent to January (Month 1).
*   **Logarithmic Squashing:** Applied `np.log1p` to handle extreme rainfall outliers while maintaining a normal distribution for training stability.
*   **Temporal Memory:** Engineered **Lag Features** (`rfh_lag1`, `rfh_lag3`) and **Rolling Means** to provide the model with a historical context of recent precipitation.

### 2. The LSTM Architecture
A stacked **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network was utilized to capture long-range temporal dependencies:
*   **Weighted Training:** To ensure the model doesn't ignore extreme weather, **sample weights (up to 10x)** were applied to heavy rainfall events during the learning phase.
*   **Loss Function:** Utilized **Huber Loss**, which is robust to outliers while maintaining high precision for standard rainfall levels.

### 3. Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Training R² Score** | `0.9845` |
| **Testing R² Score** | `0.9870` |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | `1.34 mm` |
| **PBIAS (Bias)** | `-4.32%` |

## 💻 Operational Web App (Full-Stack)

The "RainfallAI" web application provides a professional-grade interface for agronomists and researchers.

### Key Features
*   **Interactive Forecasting:** Adjust metrics like `RFH_AVG` and `Rainfall Index` via dynamic sliders to generate instant AI predictions.
*   **Ethiopian Calendar Utility:** Standard Gregorian dates are automatically converted to the local Ethiopian calendar (e.g., *Yekatit 19, 2018*).
*   **Recursive AI Sequences:** A custom logic that feeds AI predictions back into the model as "Lag" inputs, allowing users to build multi-step forward forecasts.
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek dark-themed dashboard built with **Tailwind CSS** and animated with **Framer Motion**.
